## NextGenContributions

We are a small team contributing to open source.

We publish some generic tooling and libraries to enchance better reusability across the contributors different projects and hopes of getting bigger community of contributions and interest:

- [Django-Ninja-Crudl](https://github.com/NextGenContributions/django-ninja-crudl) - A library that makes easy for Django projects to create CRUDL (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete and List) type of JSON REST API endpoints with complete and accurate OpenAPI-based schema documentation.
- [Django2Pydantic](https://github.com/NextGenContributions/django2pydantic) - A library that is the backbone of the `django-ninja-crudl` library. Creates Pydantic models from Django models. The created Pydantic models can then be used for data validation, serialization and producing accurate schema.
- [Shared linter, type checker and VSCode settings](https://github.com/NextGenContributions/.nitpick) - Our shared and find-tuned settings that can be easily synced to multiple other projects to enforce same rules and settings across multiple projects.
- [Docker base image for Python with development tooling](https://github.com/NextGenContributions/python-dev-image) - A Docker image that can be used as devcontainer base for Python project's as it contains some extras required by the linters and other tools that are used during development

You can enjoy the above as we publish them with permissible MIT license.

We welcome any type of contributions like using them, starring the projects, reporing issues, sponsoring or contributing to the code or documentation.
